# Atech-crab

![Atech-crab: Sesame with an Atech 14-port board on its back](docs/img/cover.png)

Atech-crab is [Sesame](https://github.com/dorianborian/sesame-robot), Dorian Todd's open-source quadruped: the same frame, servos, legs and moves, with an **Atech 14-port board** as its brain. The servos
plug straight into the board's ports on jumper wires, with no servo driver board. An Atech screen
in a visor at the front shows Sesame's face, and an Atech motion sensor keeps the walk on course.

Nothing under Sesame's top cover changes. The top cover is replaced by a **deck** that holds the board flat over
the legs and a **lid** that closes it. Both come from Atech Atelier's "Sesame walker".

## Status

| What | State |
|---|---|
| Firmware (`firmware/project.yaml`) | Builds with the Atech SDK and runs on the SDK's emulated board: all modules start, every move plays |
| Walking | Run in simulation (emulated board + MuJoCo): the motion sensor holds the walk within about 20° over ten cycles |
| Servo driver (`mg90s_pair`) | MG90S pulse range (500–2400 µs). Builds and runs on the emulated board; the earlier SG90 version drove an SG90 on a real 14-port board. **Not yet tried with MG90S on a board** |
| Deck and lid (v5) | Pass Atech Atelier's fit check in CAD. **Not yet printed or assembled** |

Print and test-fit the deck on the frame, with the servos in, before you print more than one set.

## What changes from Sesame

| Sesame | Atech-crab |
|---|---|
| ESP32 + distro board (or PCA9685) | Atech 14-port board (ESP32-S3). Servos on ports 2–5, two per port |
| 128×64 OLED | Atech screen module, ports 10+11, in a front visor |
| — | Atech motion sensor (icm40608), port 13: heading hold while walking, 90° turns |
| USB on the ESP32 | Atech USB-C module, port 8, at the back |
| Top cover | Deck (two printed parts, glued) + lid |
| Arduino IDE | `pip install atech`, then `atech upload` |

The moves are Sesame's own. `firmware/make_firmware.py` reads them out of this repository's
[`firmware/movement-sequences.h`](../firmware/movement-sequences.h) and sends each servo the same angle
Sesame's firmware would, as an MG90S pulse: 0–180° → 500–2400 µs. (Sesame's own firmware uses 732–2929 µs,
which drives an MG90S into its end stop above about 137°.)

## Parts

**Printed (13):** Sesame's internal frame, bottom cover, femurs L1 L2 R1 R2 and feet L3 L4 R3 R4, plus
deck part 1, deck part 2 and the lid. All 13 are in [`print/stl/`](print/stl/), turned the right way up.

**Hardware:** 8 × MG90S servos (metal gear, 180°) · Atech 14-port board · Atech USB-C module · Atech motion sensor module ·
Atech screen module with its cable · 6 × M2×8 pan-head screws · 3 × M2×10 countersunk screws ·
male-to-male jumper wires · a 5 V 3 A supply for the servos · superglue (CA).

## Print

**[3D printing guide](print/README.md)**: settings, every part and its orientation, and the wire openings.

Sliced and checked for Bambu Lab printers, PLA Basic, Textured PEI plate, 0.4 mm nozzle, 0.20 mm layers,
tree supports from the build plate only:

| Printer | File(s) in [`print/gcode/`](print/gcode/) | Time |
|---|---|---|
| H2S | `atech_crab_pla_h2s.gcode.3mf` | 4 h 35 min |
| H2D | `atech_crab_pla_h2d.gcode.3mf` | 4 h 46 min |
| X2D | `atech_crab_pla_x2d_plate1` + `_plate2` | 3 h 08 + 1 h 37 |
| P2S | `atech_crab_pla_p2s_plate1` + `_plate2` | 3 h 41 + 1 h 04 |

Other printers: slice the STLs yourself (the [guide](print/README.md) has the settings), or run
`print/slice.py` (it uses Bambu Studio's own printer profiles, so the start G-code is the printer's own)
and `print/check.py`.

## Assemble

The [PDF](docs/atech_crab_assembly.pdf) has each step with pictures. In short:

1. Build Sesame's base as in the [build guide](../docs/build-guide/README.md), but leave the bottom cover off.
2. Glue deck part 2 under deck part 1 (the lip only fits one way).
3. Feed the servo leads up the deck's spine, and screw the deck on from inside the frame (4 × M2×8).
4. Battery, bottom cover (2 × M2×8).
5. Board on the four posts, USB-C module on port 8, motion sensor on port 13, screen in the visor cabled to ports 10+11.
6. Wire the servos (below).
7. Lid (3 × M2×10 countersunk).

## Wire

| Port | Leg | Line A (pin 5) | Line B (pin 6) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | front left | L1 hip | L3 knee |
| 3 | front right | R1 hip | R3 knee |
| 4 | back left | L2 hip | L4 knee |
| 5 | back right | R2 hip | R4 knee |

Each port is a 6-pin header: 1 +12 V, 2 +5 V, 3 +3.3 V, 4 GND, 5 line A, 6 line B. Run the signal and GND
jumpers out through the slot at each port. Both sides have slots and lead notches (ports 2–6 on the right,
10–14 on the left), so a lead can leave on either side. Power the servos from the 5 V supply (red to +, brown to −), and
join the supply's − to a port's GND.

> **+12 V sits next to +5 V, and which end of the header is pin 1 is not marked.** Measure before you wire:
> with the board on USB, the pin reading 3.3 V is pin 3, and its neighbour that beeps to the USB-C shell is GND
> (pin 4). Never connect pin 1 to a servo.

## Software

```bash
pip install atech
cd atech/firmware
atech validate .
atech upload .                 # builds and flashes over USB; the first build downloads the ESP32 compiler
atech check                    # which modules answered
```

About 2.5 s after it starts, the robot stands up and plays a show: wave, walk, turn left, walk, dance, crab,
turn right, push-ups, cute, bow, shake, stand. **Hold it off the table, or give it room, the first time.**

Play any move from the laptop:

```bash
atech send spider_go walk      # rest stand wave dance swim point pushup bow cute freaky
                               # worm shake shrug dead crab walk back left right
atech monitor                  # spider_move, and spider_state (roll, pitch, yaw, servo angles) 10 times a second
```

From Python:

```python
from atech import Board

with Board.connect() as board:
    board.call("spider_go", "wave")
    for event in board.events(keys=["spider_move"]):
        print("now playing", event.value)
```

`left` and `right` repeat until the motion sensor has counted 85° (six times at most), and `walk` steers by
the sensor's heading.

**New moves:** edit `firmware/movement-sequences.h` (by hand or with
[Sesame Studio](https://github.com/dorianborian/sesame-studio)), then

```bash
python atech/firmware/make_firmware.py   # writes atech/firmware/project.yaml
atech upload atech/firmware
```

To test without a robot: `atech emulate atech/firmware --seconds 10` runs the same firmware on an emulated board.
